//! Regression tests for SCC fixed-point convergence in pass 2.
//!
//! Pass 2 uses Jacobi iteration, each file in a mutually-recursive SCC
//! is re-analysed against the *pre-iteration* `GlobalSummaries` snapshot,
//! and updates are only visible on the next iteration.  In a cross-file
//! SCC with `k` functions arranged in a chain, facts introduced at one
//! end of the chain need up to `k` iterations to propagate back to the
//! other end.
//!
//! Before this test was written, the hard cap was 3, so any SCC with
//! 4+ cross-file functions silently lost precision.  These fixtures
//! exercise a 4-cycle and assert both that the transitive finding is
//! reported and that the engine actually needed more than 3 iterations
//! to converge (proving the test is load-bearing, not incidental).
//!
//! If you raise or lower the cap in `scan::SCC_FIXPOINT_SAFETY_CAP`,
//! update the iteration-count assertions accordingly.
