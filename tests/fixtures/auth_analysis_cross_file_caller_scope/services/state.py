"""Private helper reached only from the authorized `ti_update_state`
route in `routes/task_instances.py` (cross-file caller-scope — safe side).

The helper holds the caller-scoped `session.add` sink but has NO inline
auth check and NO in-file caller.  Phase 2 cross-file caller-scope IPA
must lift the route handler's route-level auth onto this helper, so
`missing_ownership_check` / `token_override_without_validation` must NOT
fire here.
